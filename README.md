#Single-Cell Analysis Coursework Projects
This repository contains coursework projects on single-cell analysis completed as part of my studies. The projects include studies on malaria-infected mice, B-cell trajectory analysis using PAGA, and comparisons of pseudobulk performance using Harmony and BBKNN integration methods. These projects aim to understand cellular behaviors, gene expression patterns, and developmental trajectories in the context of disease models.

#Projects
1. Malaria-Infected Mice Single-Cell Analysis
This project involves analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from malaria-infected mice. The analysis includes quality control, data integration, and identification of differentially expressed genes between infected and non-infected cells.

2. B-cell Trajectory Analysis using PAGA
This project focuses on the trajectory analysis of B-cells from malaria-infected mice using PAGA (Partition-based graph abstraction). PAGA allows the exploration of cell differentiation processes, showing how the B-cells evolve across different states under disease conditions.

3. Pseudobulk Performance Comparison
This project compares the performance of pseudobulk analysis using Harmony and BBKNN integration methods. The aim is to evaluate the robustness of these methods in the integration of multi-sample scRNA-seq data and their ability to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) accurately.
